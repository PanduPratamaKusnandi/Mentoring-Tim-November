## API Description
This repository contains the API source code developed by the AIcademy team to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality for the  AIcademy. The API is built using Node.js, the Express framework and Flask, with Firestore as the database. We utilize OTP for  authentication. The API is deployed on Cloud Run and uses Firestore for its database infrastructure.

### API Endpoint Documentation
[Dokumentasi API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/36493388/2sAYHxmiJC)
<br>
We utilize this API because it is simple to implement and cost-free, ensuring it doesn't add to the system's workload or incur additional charges on the Google Cloud Platform. And secure our API with JWT tokens and OTP verification to ensure that only authorized users can access it. The tokens are provided in the `Bearer` format.
